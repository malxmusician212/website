							<h1>Malcolm Lazarow</h1>
                            <p>
                            I am currently a visiting researcher at the Wurtele Group at UC Berkeley's Physics Department; we study theoretical plasma physics.  My project is to be determined, but it will have to do with the dynamics of non-neutral plasmas and the production of antimatter.  More information on that is below, here's some type of summary about me:
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            Henri Poincare, a French mathematician from the mid-19th c to early-20th c, is prized as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. Why?
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            
                            Well, of course he had the resume that you might expect: made many discoveries, won many awards.  However, he was prized because he not only contributed greatly to mathematics research,
                             but he contributed to many different fields.  He was the embodiment of an interdisciplinary mathematician/scientist; truly, it would be a joke for me to list off the areas he contributed to, just Google him and you will quickly see what I mean.
                			</p>
                			
                			<p>
                			
                			Learning about Poincare for the first time, in college, I felt, probably for the first time, that my outlook on the world was reasonable.  I have always prized interdisciplinary thought and have studied a varied of fields.  I am an aspiring theoretical physicist,
                			but in college I had three majors: music composition, pure math, and applied math (I was at a dual degree program at Northwestern University between the school of engineering, a bachelor of science, and the school of music, a bachelor of music).  I graduated with departmental honors in pure math and applied math (which included writing two theses), and had a senior recital; Northwestern's school of music, Bienen, is a conservatory style program, and so my bachelor of music is a conservatory-style degree.
                			
                			I have played the piano and composed since I was 5 years old, and I found a love for math and science while I was homeschooling in elementary school.  My entire outlook on the world, and thus who I am as a person, is centered around this notion of glorifying diversity in all senses.
                			
                			Anyways, I hope that gives you some notion of what I am like.  Please, I am not trying to compare myself with Henri Poincare, just that my outlook on the world embodies this treasuring of interdisciplinary thought.
                            
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            My ultimate goal is to participate in active research in computational physics;
                             in particular, my interest lies in particle physics.  
                             I seek to build up my computational skills and physical knowledge to tackle problems in quantum gravity from a computational perspective.  
                             My undergraduate studies have prepared me well for such a career.  
                             During my final year of undergraduate, I wrote two honors theses; 
                             for more information please go to the "Undergraduate Theses" section and/or read about my education in the "About Me" section.</p>

							<h2>About Me/Summary of My Education Thusfar</h2>
							<p>I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1994.  Throughout my entire life, I have been in love with music and scientific explanations of the natural universe.  I began playing piano at the age of 5, and started composing soon thereafter.  In the 12th grade, I took calculus and fell in love with mathematics.</p>
                            <p>When deciding what to study in college (I attended Northwestern University), I was unable to choose between mathematics and music composition.  To make matters worse, I hadn't the slightest idea what the difference between applied mathematics and pure mathematics was (no one in my family does anything remotely related to math or music, so I grew up believing that high school mathematics exhausted all topics in the field).  Therefore, I decided that I would attain two bachelors degrees and three majors: a Bachelor of Science with majors in Engineering Sciences &amp; Applied Mathematics (ESAM) and Pure Mathematics, as well as a Bachelor of Music in Music Composition.  During my last few years, I realized the beauty of physics through some courses on electromagnetism and so I "contentrated" my ESAM major in physics.</p>
                            <p>In some sense, the story of my life is indecisiveness: I love many things and am fascinated by them, so instead of choosing between them, I study all of them and combine.  On that note, when I was in my final year at Northwestern, I decided that I wanted to write a thesis, but I could not decide between an ESAM thesis or a Pure Math thesis.  Of course, I chose to write both.</p>
